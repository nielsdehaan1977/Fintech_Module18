# PyChain Ledger
################################################################################
# You’ll make the following updates to the provided Python file for this
# Challenge, which already contains the basic `PyChain` ledger structure that
# you created throughout the module:

# Step 1: Create a Record Data Class
# * Create a new data class named `Record`. This class will serve as the
# blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger
# will store.

# Step 2: Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data
# * Change the existing `Block` data class by replacing the generic `data`
# attribute with a `record` attribute that’s of type `Record`.

# Step 3: Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface
# * Create additional user input areas in the Streamlit application. These
# input areas should collect the relevant information for each financial record
# that you’ll store in the `PyChain` ledger.

# Step 4: Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records
# * Test your complete `PyChain` ledger.

# Step 1:
# Create a Record Data Class

# Define a new Python data class named `Record`. Give this new class a
# formalized data structure that consists of the `sender`, `receiver`, and
# `amount` attributes. To do so, complete the following steps:
# 1. Define a new class named `Record`.
# 2. Add the `@dataclass` decorator immediately before the `Record` class
# definition.
# 3. Add an attribute named `sender` of type `str`.
# 4. Add an attribute named `receiver` of type `str`.
# 5. Add an attribute named `amount` of type `float`.
# Note that you’ll use this new `Record` class as the data type of your `record` attribute in the next section.

# Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data

# Rename the `data` attribute in your `Block` class to `record`, and then set
# it to use an instance of the new `Record` class that you created in the
# previous section. To do so, complete the following steps:
# 1. In the `Block` class, rename the `data` attribute to `record`.
# 2. Set the data type of the `record` attribute to `Record`.

# Code additional input areas for the user interface of your Streamlit
# application. Create these input areas to capture the sender, receiver, and
# amount for each transaction that you’ll store in the `Block` record.
# To do so, complete the following steps:
# 1. Delete the `input_data` variable from the Streamlit interface.
# 2. Add an input area where you can get a value for `sender` from the user.
# 3. Add an input area where you can get a value for `receiver` from the user.
# 4. Add an input area where you can get a value for `amount` from the user.
# 5. As part of the Add Block button functionality, update `new_block` so that `Block` consists of an attribute named `record`, which is set equal to a `Record` that contains the `sender`, `receiver`, and `amount` values. The updated `Block`should also include the attributes for `creator_id` and `prev_hash`.

# Step 4:
# Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records

# Test your complete `PyChain` ledger and user interface by running your
# Streamlit application and storing some mined blocks in your `PyChain` ledger.
# Then test the blockchain validation process by using your `PyChain` ledger.
# To do so, complete the following steps:

# 1. In the terminal, navigate to the project folder where you've coded the
#  Challenge.

# 2. In the terminal, run the Streamlit application by
# using `streamlit run pychain.py`.

# 3. Enter values for the sender, receiver, and amount, and then click the "Add
# Block" button. Do this several times to store several blocks in the ledger.

# 4. Verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit drop-down menu.
# Take a screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should detail a
# blockchain that consists of multiple blocks. Include the screenshot in the
# `README.md` file for your Challenge repository.

# 5. Test the blockchain validation process by using the web interface.
# Take a screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should indicate
# the validity of the blockchain. Include the screenshot in the `README.md`
# file for your Challenge repository.
